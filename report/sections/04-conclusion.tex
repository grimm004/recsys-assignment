\subsection{Limitations}\label{subsec:limitations}
While measures have been taken to reduce the sparsity of the data, it is still a significant problem.
For $n$ users, $m$ restaurants, and $R$ reviews, the rating matrix of size $(n, m)$ has a density of $\rho = \frac{R}{nm}$.
This means that the preprocessed dataset (of $ n \approx $ \SI{2.1e5} users, $ m \approx $ \SI{1.8e4} restaurants, and $ R \approx $ \SI{2.3e6} reviews) has density of $ \rho \approx $ \SI{6.0e-4} $ \approx 0.06\% $ (this is six times the original sampled density).

\subsection{Further Developments}\label{subsec:further-developments}
1.
Investigate the incorporation of the \textit{tip} and \textit{check-in} data in CBF\@.

2.
Make use of the friends list provided for each user would allow a friend graph to be constructed to help determine trustworthiness and reliability of users based on that of their friends.

3.
Improve recommendations and overcome the issue of sparsity, pass the filtering models over to cutting edge deep-learning models (as assessed in~\cite{zhang2019deep}).

4.
Expand the domain to include more of the businesses in the Yelp dataset, as a way to test generalisation with minimal effect on recommendations for the original domain.
